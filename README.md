  - **The AV detection rate was reduced by `60.3%` 💀💀💀**

## **Tip**
  - **If you want to convert the crypted code into an executable file, please do not use `Nuitka` ❌**
  - **If your code is already detected by fewer than 12 AVs, `0BeeF` is not necessary ❌**
  - **`0BeeF` can only reduce AV detections down to 8 at best ❌**
  - **You can use `0BeeF` together with `PyArmor` to enhance security and prevent reverse engineering 🛡️**
